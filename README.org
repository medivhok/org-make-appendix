#+title: org-make-appendix
#+startup: overview

The first intent of this project is to add, as a subheader to the appendix
of my Emacs literate configuration, the list of all the package I install.

- The list should be sorted in alphabatical order;
- each element should be under a headline of the first letter;
- the element name should be a link to the heading; and
- a link to the element website should be added like /(website)/.
